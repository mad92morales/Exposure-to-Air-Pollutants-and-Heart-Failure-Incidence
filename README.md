## Overview

This research project explores the interaction between air pollution exposure, genetic risk, and heart failure incidence using UK Biobank data. By integrating environmental data (e.g., PM₂.₅, NO₂, NOₓ), polygenic risk scores (PRS), and proteomic biomarkers (IL-6, SOD1, SOD2), the study aims to uncover how these factors interact biologically and statistically to influence cardiovascular outcomes.

## Objectives

1. Assess whether air pollution exposure (PM₂.₅, NO₂, NOₓ) is associated with heart failure.
2. Evaluate whether genetic susceptibility (PRS) modifies these associations.
3. Examine whether proteomic markers (IL-6, SOD1, SOD2) mediate or interact with pollution effects.
4. Account for genetic ancestry using principal component analysis (PCA).

## Data Sources

- **UK Biobank** cohort (n ≈ 500,000).
- Air pollution exposure: ESCAPE Land Use Regression (LUR) model.
- Genetic data: PRS computed using PRSice-2 and GWAS summary statistics.
- Proteomic data: Olink Explore 3000 panel.

---

## Statistical Methods

- Logistic and linear regression (base, stepwise, interaction models).
- Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) for collinearity diagnostics.
- Stratified analysis by PRS tertile.
- Principal Component Adjustment for ancestry.

## Key Results

- **Pollutant associations (unadjusted)**: PM₂.₅ and NOₓ were positively associated; NO₂ inversely.
- **PRS effect**: Strong and consistent across all models (p < 2e-16).
- **Gene–environment interaction**: All interactions (e.g., PM₂.₅ × PRS) significant.
- **Proteomic biomarker IL-6**: Strong predictor (p < 0.001), even when adjusting for PCs.
- **Adjustment for PCs**: Diminished pollution effects; PRS and IL-6 remained significant.
